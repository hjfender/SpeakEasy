Ned Red MouseMy Name is Rascal Read, the best dog in the world.

I am a border collie mix of some variety. Lab maybe? Who really knows? 
My favorite game is Chase, and my People say I'm pretty smart. 

I have an arch rival, can you believe that? This crazy other dog named Dede. I can't stand her. We fight whenever we meet.
